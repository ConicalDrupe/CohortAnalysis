# CohortAnalysis

Here we perfore a simple cohort analysis of online retail vendor in UK, selling products ranging from office supplies and jiggsaw puzzles to cooking equipment.
Judging that this is a worldwide vendor (shipping to Europe, US, Canada, and Australia) I want to discover if there is a trend in customer purchases and if this behavior can be leveraged in the suppliers favor.
# Questions
1) What is the most purchased item? What is the most returned item? Why(misorder, damaged, etc.)?
2) Who is our biggest customer? (country, what items do they buy)
3) Are there any long term customer trends that we can take advantage of as the vendor?

# Process
1) Obtain and Clean Data (Dataset obtained from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)
2) EDA and Filtering/Grouping by Country, Quantity Sold, Profits
3) Seperate Customers into Cohorts by Month and Year of first purchase
